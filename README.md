This is the implemetation of the algorithmn introduced in the [CTSP Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9743950)

# Start
To Run the code, start from CAM.m or SimVessel.m

# Folder Structure
"fdct" folder includes the curvelet transform/inverse transform introduced by E. J. Candès and D. L. Donoho, “Curvelets—A surprisingly effective nonadaptive representation for objects with edges” in Curve and Surface Fitting 1999
"recon" folder includes the iteration function used for recover the incomplete image
"data" folder includes the incomplete/complete data from a simulated vessel and an in-vivo chicken embryo chorioallantoicmembrane (CAM)
