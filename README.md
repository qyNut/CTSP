This is the implemetation of the algorithmn introduced in the [CTSP Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9743950)

# Start
To Run the code, start from CAM.m or SimVessel.m

# Folder Structure
"fdct" folder includes the curvelet transform/inverse transform introduced by E. J. Cand√®s [[Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform]](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/05064182X)

"recon" folder includes the iteration function used for recover the incomplete image

"data" folder includes the incomplete/complete data from a simulated vessel and an in-vivo chicken embryo chorioallantoicmembrane (CAM)
